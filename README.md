# NasuaOS

Modern hobby operating system primarily targeting **x86_64** computers, written from scratch in **C++**.

Experimental support is planned for **AArch64**, **LoongArch64**, and **RISC-V**. The architecture is designed to be portable, but these targets are currently untested.

NasuaOS is an experimental operating system focused on learning, low-level programming, kernel development, and building a complete system from the ground up.

## About

NasuaOS is a hobby operating system developed from scratch with a focus on performance, simplicity, and learning low-level system programming.

The project includes its own kernel, memory manager, drivers, graphical user interface, shell, filesystem, and applications. Every component is designed specifically for NasuaOS without relying on existing operating system kernels.

The long-term goal is to create a modern, lightweight operating system capable of running on both virtual machines and real hardware.
